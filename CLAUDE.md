# Food app

When deciding what to implement, consult @REQUIREMENTS.md. If unclear, don't guess. Instead, ask me and update @REQUIREMENTS.md. Only write code once the requirement is clear. Remember to update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN with progress

Tech stack:
- Next.js
- PostgreSQL
- Typescript
- Cypress

# Remember
- Always use bun over npm
- Each piece of UI functionality should have a Cypress test
- Whenever you make changes, run:
  - `bun typecheck`
  - `bun test`
- Don't start the dev server. Ask me to do it for you
